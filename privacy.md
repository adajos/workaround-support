*Last updated: February 24, 2026*

## The Short Version

Wordaround does not collect, store, or share any of your personal data. Everything stays on your device.

## Data Collection

Wordaround does **not** collect:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Location data
- Usage or analytics data
- Device identifiers or fingerprints
- Health, fitness, or financial data

The app contains **no** analytics frameworks, advertising SDKs, or third-party tracking tools of any kind.

## Data Storage

All game data — including your progress, scores, settings, and preferences — is stored locally on your device. None of this data is transmitted to any server.

## Accounts and Sign-In

Wordaround does not require or offer account creation or sign-in.

## Third-Party Services

Wordaround does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data.

## Children's Privacy

Wordaround does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## App Store

When you download Wordaround, Apple may collect information as described in [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/). This is handled entirely by Apple and is outside the developer's control.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted here with a revised date. Since the app collects no data, meaningful changes are unlikely.
