# Wordaround Support

**Wordaround** is a word puzzle game where two anchor letters are locked in place and you build as many words as you can around them. Available on iPhone and iPad.

## How to Play

Each puzzle gives you a set of letter tiles with two **anchor letters** fixed in position. Type letters into the remaining tiles to form valid words. The game automatically recognizes valid words as you go — no need to hit submit.

Wordaround features three modes:

- **Puzzle of the Day** — A new puzzle every day, with difficulty that builds through the week.
- **Practice Mode** — Unlimited puzzles at your own pace. Choose your word length and play without pressure.
- **Progressive Mode** — The anchor letters stay the same but shift positions each round, getting progressively harder.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is the daily puzzle scored?**
Points are based on word length and letter rarity. Longer words and words using uncommon letters score higher.

**Is an internet connection required?**
No. All puzzles are generated locally on your device. You can play entirely offline.

**Does the daily puzzle change based on my time zone?**
The daily puzzle is the same for everyone worldwide on a given calendar date, based on your device's local date.

**What word list does Wordaround use?**
Wordaround uses a comprehensive English word list that includes common words and their standard forms (plurals, past tense, etc.). Some words may be unfamiliar — that's part of the challenge!

**Can I sync my progress across devices?**
Not currently, but this is something I'm considering for a future update.
